## Usage

To explore the capabilities of the scDiagnosis package, you can load your own data or use the provided example with publicly available data of Marrow tissue single cell gene expression profiles from He S et al. (2020). Single-cell transcriptome profiling of an adult human cell atlas of 15 major organs. Genome Biol 21, 1:294. This dataset is obtained from the scRNAseq R package and is used for analyzing and visualizing diagnostic plots to inspect query/test and reference datasets and check the appropriateness of cell type assignments. In the provided example, the dataset is divided into 70% reference and 30% query data.

## Scatter Plot: Total UMI Counts vs. Annotation Scores

Load the Marrow dataset for demonstration purposes. The dataset
represents single-cell gene expression profiles of Marrow tissue. In
this example, we will analyze the relationship between total UMI (Unique
Molecular Identifier) counts and SingleR scores for a specific cell
type.

To perform this analysis, we first divide the dataset into reference and
query datasets. The reference dataset serves as a reference for cell
type annotation, while the query dataset contains cells that we want to
assign cell types to. We then log-transform the expression values in
both datasets for further analysis. Next, we use the SingleR package to 
obtain cell type scores for the query dataset. 

For the scatter plot, we focus on a specific cell type, in this case,
CD4. We extract the corresponding SingleR scores for this cell type
from the SingleR results. We then assign the SingleR scores to the colData of 
the query dataset for easy accessibility. 

Itâ€™s important to note that the use of SingleR for cell type annotation
is just one example. Users can use any other cell type annotation method
to obtain cell type scores. The scatter plot can be used 
for further examination and interpretation of the cell type assignments 
in the dataset.

```{r Scatter plot Total UMIs vs annotation scores, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

   # Load data
   sce <- HeOrganAtlasData(tissue = c("Marrow"), ensembl = FALSE)

   # Divide the data into reference and query datasets
   indices <- sample(ncol(assay(sce)), size = floor(0.7 * ncol(assay(sce))), replace = FALSE)
   ref_data <- sce[, indices]
   query_data <- sce[, -indices]

   # Log-transform datasets
   ref_data <- logNormCounts(ref_data)
   query_data <- logNormCounts(query_data)

   # Run PCA
   ref_data <- runPCA(ref_data)
   query_data <- runPCA(query_data)

   # Get cell type scores using SingleR
   pred <- SingleR(query_data, ref_data, labels = ref_data$reclustered.broad)

   # Extract scores and labels for a specific cell type
   cell_type <- "CD4"
   score <- pred$scores[pred$labels == cell_type, cell_type]
  
   # Assign labels to query data
   colData(query_data)$labels <- pred$labels

   # Generate scatter plot for Total UMIs vs. Annotation Scores
   plotUMIsAnnotationScatter(query_data, score, "labels", cell_type)
```

## Examining Distribution of UMI Counts and Annotation Scores

In addition to the scatter plot, we can gain further visualize the distribution of total UMI (Unique Molecular Identifier) counts 
and annotation scores for a specific cell type. This can help in investigation of variations and patterns in cell type scores and gene expression levels.

To accomplish this, we create two separate histograms. The first histogram displays the distribution of the annotation scores. 

The second histogram visualizes the distribution of total log-transformed UMI counts per cell. This provides insights into the
overall gene expression levels for the specific cell type. 

Histograms of both annotation scores and total UMI counts can give insights into the range, shape, and potential outliers in the distributions.

```{r Distribution of UMIs and Annotation Score, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Generate histogram
plotCellTypeDistribution(score, query_data, cell_type)
```

The example code provided demonstrates how to use the plotCellTypeDistribution function. Here we are visualizing the distribution of counts and scores for the CD4 cell type.

## Exploring Gene Expression Distribution

In the provided example, we are examining the distribution of expression values for the gene VPREB3 in the dataset. The function generates a histogram to display the distribution of expression values across all cells. Additionally, the expression values can be further stratified by specific cell types.

```{r histogram gene expression, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Generate histogram
plotGeneExpressionDistribution(query_data, "labels", "B_and_plasma", "VPREB3")
```

In the provided example, we are examining the distribution of expression values for the gene VPREB3 in the dataset. The function generates a histogram to display the distribution of expression values across all cells. Additionally, the expression values can be further stratified by specific cell types.

## Visualize Gene Expression on Dimensional Reduction Plot

To gain insights into the marker gene expression patterns and their representation in a dimensional reduction space, we can utilize the plotGeneExpressionDimred function. This function allows user to plot the gene expression values of a specific gene on a dimensional reduction plot generated using methods like TSNE, UMAP, or PCA.

In the provided example, we are visualizing the gene expression values of the gene VPREB3 on a PCA plot. Each cell is represented as a point on the plot, and its color reflects the expression level of the gene VPREB3 ranging from low (lighter color) to high (darker color).

```{r scatter plot gene expression, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Generate dimension reduction plot color code by gene expression
plotGeneExpressionDimred(query_data, "PCA", c(1, 2), "VPREB3")
```

## Visualize Gene Sets or Pathway Scores on Dimensional Reduction Plot

It is often useful to assess the collective activity of gene sets or pathways within single cells. This can provide insights into the functional states associated with specific cell types. To facilitate this analysis, the scDiagnosis package 
includes a function called plotGeneSetScores that enables the visualization of gene set or pathway scores on a dimensional reduction plot.

The plotGeneSetScores function allows you to plot gene set or pathway scores on a dimensional reduction plot generated using methods such as PCA, TSNE, or UMAP. 

```{r Visualize gene set or pathway scores on dimensional reduction scatter plot , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Compute scores using AUCell
expression_matrix <- assay(query_data, "logcounts")
cells_rankings <- AUCell_buildRankings(expression_matrix, plotStats = F)

# Generate gene sets
gene_set1 <- sample(rownames(expression_matrix), 10)
gene_set2 <- sample(rownames(expression_matrix), 20)

gene_sets <- list(geneSet1 = gene_set1,
                  geneSet2 = gene_set2)

# Calculate AUC scores for gene sets
cells_AUC <- AUCell_calcAUC(gene_sets, cells_rankings)

# Assign scores to colData
colData(query_data)$geneSetScores <- assay(cells_AUC)["geneSet1", ]

# Plot gene set scores on PCA
plotGeneSetScores(query_data, method = "PCA", feature = "geneSetScores")
```

In the provided example, we demonstrate the usage of the plotGeneSetScores function using the AUCell package to compute gene set or pathway scores. Example gene sets are generated for demonstration purposes, but users can provide their own gene set scores using any method of their choice. It is important to ensure that the scores are assigned to the colData of the query_data object and specify the correct feature name for visualization.

## Visualizing Reference and Query Cell Types using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)

Here, we perform Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis on the query and reference datasets to examine their similarity. The dissimilarity matrix is calculated based on the correlation between the datasets, and MDS is used to obtain low-dimensional coordinates for each cell. Subsequently, a scatter plot is generated, where each data point represents a cell, and the cell types are color-coded using custom colors provided by the user. This visualization enables the comparison of cell type distributions between the query and reference datasets in a reduced-dimensional space.

```{r CMD scatter plot, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Selcting highly variable genes
ref_var <- getTopHVGs(ref_data, n=2000)
query_var <- getTopHVGs(query_data, n=2000)

# Intersect the gene symbols to obtain common genes
common_genes <- intersect(ref_var, query_var)

# Select desired cell types
selected_cell_types <- c("CD4", "CD8", "B_and_plasma")
ref_data_subset <- ref_data[common_genes, ref_data$reclustered.broad %in% selected_cell_types]
query_data_subset <- query_data[common_genes, query_data$reclustered.broad %in% selected_cell_types]

# Extract cell types for visualization
ref_labels <- ref_data_subset$reclustered.broad
query_labels <- query_data_subset$reclustered.broad

# Combine the cell type labels from both datasets
mdata <- c(paste("Query", query_labels), paste("Reference", ref_labels))

## Define the cell types and legend order
cell_types <- c("Query CD8", "Reference CD8", "Query CD4", "Reference CD4", "Query B_and_plasma", "Reference B_and_plasma")
legend_order <- cell_types

## Define the colors for cell types
color_palette <- brewer.pal(length(cell_types), "Paired")
color_mapping <- setNames(color_palette, cell_types)
cell_type_colors <- color_mapping[cell_types]

## Generate the MDS scatter plot with cell type coloring
visualizeCellTypeMDS(query_data_subset, ref_data_subset, mdata, cell_type_colors, legend_order)
```

Upon examining the MDS scatter plot, we observe that the CD4 and CD8 cell types overlap to some extent. By observing the proximity or overlap of different cell types, we can gain insights into their potential relationships or shared characteristics.

The selection of custom genes and desired cell types depends on the userâ€™s research interests and goals, allowing for flexibility in focusing on specific genes and examining particular cell types of interest for investigating into their similarities or dissimilarities.

## Cell Type-specific Pairwise Correlation Analysis and Visualization

This analysis aims to explore the correlation patterns between different cell types in a query and reference dataset. It involves
comparing the gene expression profiles of cells from a reference dataset and a query dataset.

To perform the analysis, we start by computing the pairwise correlations between the query and reference cells for selected cell types. As an example, we have considered CD4, CD8, B_and_plasma cells. The Spearman correlation method is used, user can also use Pearsons correlation coeefficient.

This will return average correlation matrix which can be visulaized by userâ€™s method of choice. Here, the results are visualized as a correlation plot using the corrplot package.


```{r Cell Type-specific Pairwise Correlation Analysis and Visualization , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
selected_cell_types <- c("CD4", "CD8", "B_and_plasma")
cor_matrix_avg <- computeAveragePairwiseCorrelation(query_data_subset, ref_data_subset, "labels", "reclustered.broad", selected_cell_types, "spearman")

# Plot the pairwise average correlations using corrplot
corrplot(cor_matrix_avg, method = "number", tl.col = "black")
```

This analysis allows us to examine the correlation patterns between different cell types in the query and reference datasets. By
visualizing the average pairwise correlations, we can gain insights into the dissimilarties and similarities between cell types based on their gene expression profiles.

Users can select their own set of genes and cell types that they consider relevant for computing the pairwise correlations. For demonstartion we have used common highly variable genes from reference and query dataset.

## Pairwise Distance Analysis and Density Visualization

This function allows for the calculation of pairwise distances between query and reference cells of a specific cell type in a single cell gene expression dataset. The pairwise distances are calculated using a specified distance metric, such as euclidean, manhattan, etc. The function generates density plots to visualize the distribution of distances for different pairwise comparisons.

The analysis focuses on the specific cell type CD8, and the pairwise distances are calculated using the euclidean distance metric.


```{r Pairwise Distance Analysis and Density Visualization, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8}
calculatePairwiseDistancesAndPlotDensity(query_data_subset, ref_data_subset, "labels", "reclustered.broad", "CD8", "euclidean")
```

Further, user can also use correlation for calculation of pairwise distances between query and reference cells of a specific cell type. 

The analysis focuses on the specific cell type CD8 and the pairwise distances are calculated using the correlation distance metric. User can use spearman or pearson correlation coefficient as a method of choice.

```{r Pairwise Distance Analysis and Density Visualization correlation based, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8}
calculatePairwiseDistancesAndPlotDensity(query_data_subset, ref_data_subset, "labels", "reclustered.broad", "CD8", "correlation" ,"spearman")
```

Users can explore the pairwise distances between query and reference cells of a specific cell type and gain insights into the distribution of distances through density plots. This analysis aids in understanding the similarities and differences for the selected cell type within the query and reference datasets.

## Linear regression analysis

Performing linear regression analysis on a reference or query dataset enables users to examine the relationship between a principal component (PC) from the dimension reduction slot and an independent variable of interest. By specifying the desired dependent variable as one of the principal components and providing the corresponding independent variable from the colData slot, users can explore the associations between these variables within the single-cell
gene expression dataset (reference and query).

```{r linear regression ,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
summary <- performLinearRegression(query_data, "PC1", "labels")
print(summary)
```

By conducting linear regression, one can assess whether the PC values are significantly associated with the cell types. This analysis helps uncover whether there is a systematic variation in PC values across different cell types. Understanding the relationship between PC values and cell types can provide valuable insights into the biological or technical factors driving cellular heterogeneity. 

## Conclusion

In this analysis, we have demonstrated the capabilities of the scDiagnosis package for assessing the appropriateness of cell assignments in single-cell gene expression profiles. By utilizing various diagnostic functions and visualization techniques, we have explored different aspects of the data, including total UMI counts, annotation scores, gene expression distributions, dimensional reduction plots, gene set scores, pairwise correlations, pairwise distances, and linear regression analysis.
