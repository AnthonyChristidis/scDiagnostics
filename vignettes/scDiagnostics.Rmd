# Purpose


Annotation transfer from a reference dataset is a key process for annotating cell types in new single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments. This approach provides a quick, automated, and reproducible alternative to manual annotation based on marker gene expression. Despite its advantages, challenges such as dataset imbalance and unrecognized discrepancies between query and reference datasets can lead to inaccurate annotations and affect subsequent analyses.

The `scDiagnostics` package is designed to address these issues by offering a suite of diagnostic tools for the systematic evaluation of cell type assignments in scRNA-seq data. It provides functionality to assess whether query and reference datasets are well-aligned, which is crucial for ensuring accurate annotation transfer. In addition, `scDiagnostics` helps evaluate annotation ambiguity, cluster heterogeneity, and marker gene alignment. By providing insights into these aspects, `scDiagnostics` enables researchers to determine the precision with which cells from a new scRNA-seq experiment can be assigned to known cell types, thereby supporting more accurate and reliable downstream analysis.

# Installation

To install the development version of the package from Github, use the
following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
devtools::install_github("ccb-hms/scDiagnostics")
```

NOTE: you will need the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/index.html)
package to install from GitHub.

To build the package vignettes upon installation use:

```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
devtools::install_github("ccb-hms/scDiagnostics",
                          build_vignettes = TRUE,
                          dependencies = TRUE)
```

Once you have installed the package, you can load it with the following code:

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
library(scDiagnostics)
```

# Preliminaries
To explore the full capabilities of the `scDiagnostics` package, you have the option to use your own data or leverage the datasets included within the scDiagnostics package itself. In this guide, we will focus on utilizing these built-in datasets, which provide a practical and convenient resource for demonstrating the features of `scDiagnostics.` These datasets are specifically designed to facilitate the exploration of the package's functionalities and to help evaluate the accuracy of cell type assignments. You can learn more about the datasets by looking at the documentation of the datasets available in the reference manual.

## Loading Datasets

In these datasets available in the `scDiagnostics` package, `reference_data`, `query_data`, and `qc_data` are all `SingleCellExperiment` objects that include a `logcounts` assay, which stores the log-transformed expression values for the genes.

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
# Load datasets
data("reference_data")
data("query_data")
data("qc_data")

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(0)
```
The `reference_data` object is a curated dataset that has been cleaned and processed, and it contains column data labeled `expert_annotation`, which provides cell type annotations assigned by experts. On the other hand, `query_data` also includes `expert_annotation`, but it additionally features `SingleR_annotation`, which is the cell type annotation generated by the `SingleR` package, a popular package for cell type assignment based on reference datasets. The `qc_data` object contains a special column called `annotation_scores`, which holds the scores from the `SingleR` annotations, providing a measure of confidence or relevance for the assigned cell types.

By working with these datasets, you can gain hands-on experience with the various diagnostic tools and functions offered by scDiagnostics, allowing you to better understand how well it aligns query and reference datasets, assesses annotation ambiguity, and evaluates cluster heterogeneity and marker gene alignment.

## Subsetting the Datasets

Some functions in the vignette are designed to work with `SingleCellExperiment` objects that contain data from only one cell type. We will create separate `SingleCellExperiment` objects that only CD4 cells, to ensure compatibility with these functions.
```{r, message=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
# Load library
library(scran)
library(scater)

# Subset to CD4 cells
ref_data_cd4 <- reference_data[, which(reference_data$expert_annotation == "CD4")]
query_data_cd4 <- query_data_cd4 <- query_data[, which(query_data$expert_annotation == "CD4")]

# Select highly variable genes
ref_top_genes <- getTopHVGs(ref_data_cd4, n = 500)
query_top_genes <- getTopHVGs(query_data_cd4, n = 500)
common_genes <- intersect(ref_top_genes, query_top_genes)

# Subset data by common genes
ref_data_cd4 <- ref_data_cd4[common_genes,]
query_data_cd4 <- query_data_cd4[common_genes,]

# Run PCA on both datasets
ref_data_cd4 <- runPCA(ref_data_cd4)
query_data_cd4 <- runPCA(query_data_cd4)
```


# Getting Started with `scDiagnostics`

**The functions introduced in this section represent just a subset of the functions available in the `scDiagnostics` package.** 

For a complete overview and detailed demonstrations of all the functions included in the package, please refer to the designated vignettes which you may browse from the [pkgdown site for `scDiagnostics`](https://ccb-hms.github.io/scDiagnostics/). Each vignette is designed to address specific aspects of `scDiagnostics`, and this vignette highlights key functionalities to illustrate their applications. These vignettes provide in-depth guidance and examples for each function, helping users fully leverage the capabilities of `scDiagnostics` in their single-cell analyses. 

# Visualization of Cell Type Annotations

For a detailed example of all possible functions to visualize reference and query datasets, please refer to the [Visualization of Cell Type Annotations](https://ccb-hms.github.io/scDiagnostics/articles/VisualizationTools.html) vignette.


## `plotCellTypePCA`

The `plotCellTypePCA` function provides a visual comparison of principal components (PCs) for different cell types across query and reference datasets. By projecting the query data onto the PCA space of the reference dataset, it creates informative plots to help you understand how various cell types are distributed in the principal component space.
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.show='hide'}
# Plot PCA data
pc_plot <- plotCellTypePCA(query_data = query_data, 
                           reference_data = reference_data,
                           cell_types = c("CD4", "CD8", "B_and_plasma", "Myeloid"),
                           query_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation", 
                           ref_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation",
                           pc_subset = 1:3)
# Display plot
pc_plot
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccb-hms/scDiagnostics/main/inst/extdata/compressed/scDiagnostics/plotCellTypePCA.png)


The function returns a `ggplot` object featuring pairwise scatter plots of the selected principal components. Each plot compares how different cell types from the query and reference datasets project onto the PCA space. This visualization aids in identifying how cell types distribute across PCs and facilitates comparisons between datasets.

The `reference_data` argument contains the reference cell data, which serves as the foundation for defining the PC space. The `query_data` parameter includes the query cell data that will be projected. The function uses the `ref_cell_type_col` and `query_cell_type_col` to identify the relevant cell type annotations in the reference and query datasets.

## `calculateDiscriminantSpace`

Alternatively, you can also use the `calculateDiscriminantSpace` function, which projects query single-cell RNA-seq data onto a discriminant space defined by a reference dataset. This approach helps evaluate the similarity between the query and reference data, offering insights into the classification of query cells. 
```{r, fig.show='hide'}
disc_output <- calculateDiscriminantSpace(reference_data = reference_data,
                                          query_data = query_data, 
                                          ref_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation",
                                          query_cell_type_col = "SingleR_annotation")
```


The function returns a comprehensive output that includes discriminant eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which represent the variance explained by each discriminant axis and are used to project the data. It also provides the projections of the reference and query data onto the discriminant space. The Mahalanobis distances between the query and reference cell types are calculated, offering insights into how close the query projections are to the reference. The cosine similarity scores provide another metric to assess the similarity between the datasets.
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.show='hide'}
plot(disc_output, plot_type = "scatterplot")
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccb-hms/scDiagnostics/main/inst/extdata/compressed/scDiagnostics/calculateDiscriminantSpace.png)

Alternatively, you can create a boxplot comparing query and reference projections for a specific cell type. See the reference manual for an example.

## Visualization of Marker Expressions

Visualizing gene expression distributions is crucial for understanding dataset similarity and cell type-specific expression patterns. The `plotMarkerExpression` function allows you to compare the expression levels of a specific gene between a reference dataset and a query dataset, both overall and within a specified cell type. This comparison is done using density plots, which help in assessing the alignment and potential discrepancies between datasets.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.show='hide', fig.show='hide'}
plotMarkerExpression(reference_data = reference_data, 
                     query_data = query_data, 
                     ref_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation", 
                     query_cell_type_col = "SingleR_annotation", 
                     gene_name = "VPREB3", 
                     cell_type = "B_and_plasma")
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccb-hms/scDiagnostics/main/inst/extdata/compressed/scDiagnostics/plotMarkerExpression.png)
# Visualization of QC and Annotation Scores

For a detailed example of all possible functions to visualize quality control and annotation score metrics, please refer to the [Visualization of QC and Annotation Scores](https://ccb-hms.github.io/scDiagnostics/articles/VisualizationTools.html) vignette.


The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between key QC metrics (e.g., total library size, percentage of mitochondrial genes) and cell type annotation scores. This visualization aids in assessing how QC factors might influence or correlate with the assigned cell type annotations.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.show='hide'}
# Generate scatter plot
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- plotQCvsAnnotation(se_object = qc_data,
                         cell_type_col = "SingleR_annotation",
                         qc_col = "total",
                         score_col = "annotation_scores")
p1 + xlab("Library Size")
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccb-hms/scDiagnostics/main/inst/extdata/compressed/scDiagnostics/plotQCvsAnnotation.png)

This scatter plot can uncover patterns, such as whether cells with larger library sizes or higher mitochondrial content are linked to specific annotations. For example, cells exhibiting unusually high mitochondrial content may be flagged as low-quality or stressed, which could impact their annotation accuracy.



# Evaluation of Dataset and Marker Gene Alignment

For a detailed example of all possible functions to assess the alignment of datasets and marker genes, please refer to the [Evaluation of Dataset and Marker Gene Alignment](https://ccb-hms.github.io/scDiagnostics/articles/https://ccb-hms.github.io/scDiagnostics/articles/DatasetAlignment.html) vignette.

## `compareCCA`

The `compareCCA` function is designed to compare the subspaces spanned by the top principal components (PCs) of two datasets using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). The function calculates canonical variables, correlations, and a similarity measure between the subspaces of the reference and query datasets. This can be useful in determining the similarity of cell populations or other high-dimensional data structures across different conditions or datasets.
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.show='hide'}
# Perform CCA comparison
cca_comparison <- compareCCA(query_data = query_data_cd4, 
                             reference_data = ref_data_cd4, 
                             query_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation", 
                             ref_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation")
# Visualize results
plot(cca_comparison)
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccb-hms/scDiagnostics/main/inst/extdata/compressed/scDiagnostics/compareCCA.png)

This function is useful for identifying similarities and differences in cellular subpopulations or other high-dimensional datasets across different conditions. The combination of CCA with PCA provides a reliable framework for subspace comparison.




## `plotWassersteinDistance`

The code below illustrates how to use the `plotWassersteinDistance` function to compare the Wasserstein distances between CD4 cells in the reference and query datasets. The resulting plot provides insight into whether the differences between the datasets are statistically significant.


```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.show='hide'}
# Generate the Wasserstein distance density plot
plotWassersteinDistance(query_data = query_data_cd4,
                        reference_data = ref_data_cd4, 
                        query_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation", 
                        ref_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation", 
                        pc_subset = 1:5,
                        alpha = 0.05)
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccb-hms/scDiagnostics/main/inst/extdata/compressed/scDiagnostics/plotWassersteinDistance.png)


## `calculateVarImpOverlap`

Imagine you have two sets of data: one called reference_data and another called query_data. Both sets include information about gene expression and cell types, with columns named `expert_annotation` for the reference data and `SingleR_annotation` for the query data. You want to find out which genes are most important for each dataset and then compare them.

Here’s how you can do it with the function:
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.show='hide'}
# RF function to compare (between datasets) which genes are best at differentiating cell types
rf_output <- calculateVarImpOverlap(reference_data = reference_data, 
                                    query_data = query_data, 
                                    query_cell_type_col = "SingleR_annotation", 
                                    ref_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation", 
                                    n_tree = 500,
                                    n_top = 50)

# Comparison table
rf_output$var_imp_comparison
```


# Statistical Measures to Assess Dataset Alignment

For a detailed example of all possible functions that implement statistical methods to assess cell type annotation, please refer to the [Statistical Measures to Assess Dataset Alignment](https://ccb-hms.github.io/scDiagnostics/articles/StatisticalMeasures.html) vignette.


## `calculateAveragePairwiseCorrelation`

The `calculateAveragePairwiseCorrelation` function computes the average pairwise correlations between specified cell types in single-cell gene expression data. It calculates pairwise correlations between query and reference cells using a specified correlation method, and then averages these correlations for each cell type pair. This approach helps assess the similarity between cells in reference and query datasets and provides insights into the reliability of cell type annotations.
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.show='hide'}
# Compute pairwise correlations between specified cell types
cor_matrix_avg <- calculateAveragePairwiseCorrelation(
  query_data = query_data, 
  reference_data = reference_data, 
  query_cell_type_col = "SingleR_annotation", 
  ref_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation", 
  cell_types = c("CD4", "CD8", "B_and_plasma"), 
  pc_subset = 1:5,
  correlation_method = "spearman"
)

# Visualize the average pairwise correlation matrix
round(cor_matrix_avg, 2)
```

Note that the object returned by `calculateAveragePairwiseCorrelation` includes a plot method, similar to most functions in this package. For more details, please refer to the reference manual.


# Detection of Annotation Anomalies

For a detailed example of all possible functions that implement statistical methods to assess cell type annotation, please refer to the [Detection of Annotation Anomalies](https://ccb-hms.github.io/scDiagnostics/articles/AnnotationAnomalies.html) vignette.

The `detectAnomaly` function is designed to identify anomalies in single-cell data by leveraging PCA projections and the Isolation Forest algorithm. This method is useful for detecting anomalies or unusual patterns in single-cell datasets, whether you're analyzing a reference dataset or comparing a query dataset against it.

The function projects single-cell data onto a PCA space and builds an Isolation Forest model on this PCA space to detect anomalies. If a query dataset is provided, the function computes anomaly scores for the query data based on its PCA projections relative to the reference data. If no query data is provided, it computes anomaly scores for the reference data itself.
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.show='hide'}
# Perform anomaly detection
anomaly_output <- detectAnomaly(reference_data = reference_data, 
                                query_data = query_data, 
                                ref_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation", 
                                query_cell_type_col = "SingleR_annotation")
# Plot the results for a specific cell type
plot(anomaly_output, 
     cell_type = "CD4", 
     data_type = "query",
     pc_subset = 1:3)
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccb-hms/scDiagnostics/main/inst/extdata/compressed/scDiagnostics/detectAnomaly.png)


# Calculation of Distances Between Specific Cells and Cell Types

For a detailed example of all possible functions to analyze distances between specific cells and cell distributions, please refer to the [Calculation of Distances Between Specific Cells and Cell Types](https://ccb-hms.github.io/scDiagnostics/articles/CellDistancesDiagnostics.html) vignette.


The `calculateCellDistances` function computes distances both within a reference dataset and between query cells and reference cells for each specified cell type. By first projecting data onto a PCA space, the function calculates Euclidean distances to quantify similarities and dissimilarities. For each cell type, it generates pairwise distances within the reference dataset and measures how far each query cell is from all reference cells. This approach enables detailed analysis of cell type-specific distances, aiding in the identification of outliers and other patterns of interest.

To identify anomalous cells within the query data, we first use the `detectAnomaly` function, focusing specifically on the CD4 cell type. This function will compute anomaly scores for each CD4 cell in the query dataset based on their projection in the PCA space of the reference data. Next, we will plot the distance distributions for the top 6 CD4 cells with the highest anomaly scores. These distances, computed using the `calculateCellDistances` function, will illustrate how these anomalous cells differ from the reference cells, providing insight into their potential outlier status and helping to visualize patterns within the data.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.show='hide'}
# Identify outliers for CD4
cd4_anomalies <- detectAnomaly(reference_data = reference_data, 
                               query_data = query_data, 
                               query_cell_type_col = "SingleR_annotation", 
                               ref_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation")
cd4_top6_anomalies <- names(sort(cd4_anomalies$CD4$query_anomaly_scores, decreasing = TRUE)[1:6])

# Plot the PC data
distance_data <- calculateCellDistances(query_data = query_data, 
                                        reference_data = reference_data, 
                                        query_cell_type_col = "SingleR_annotation", 
                                        ref_cell_type_col = "expert_annotation") 

# Plot the densities of the distances
plot(distance_data, ref_cell_type = "CD4", cell_names = cd4_top6_anomalies)
```
